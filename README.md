# Form3 Platform Interview

Platform engineers at Form3 build highly available distributed systems using infrastructure as code. Our take home test is designed to evaluate real world activities that are involved with this role. We recognise that this may not be as mentally challenging and may take longer to implement than some algorithmic tests that are often seen in interview exercises. Our approach however helps ensure that you will be working with a team of engineers with the necessary practical skills for the role (as well as a diverse range of technical wizardry).


## 🧪 Sample application
The sample application consists of three services:

```mermaid
graph TD;

payment-->vault;
account-->vault;
gateway-->vault;

```                 

Each service connects to [vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) to retrieve database credentials.

The project structure is as follows:

```
.
├── docker-compose.yml
├── form3.crt
├── README.md
├── run.sh
├── Vagrantfile
├── services
│   ├── account
│   ├── gateway
│   └── payment
└── tf
    └── main.tf
```
1. Refactoring the Terraform code found in the [tf](./tf) directory is the primary focus of this test.
1. `Vagrantfile`, `run.sh` and `docker-compose.yml` are used to bootstrap this sample application; refactoring these files is not part of the test, but these files may be modified if your solution requires it.
1. `form3.crt` is used to ease sandboxed running of the submission by Form3 staff and can be ignored.
1. The `services` code is used to simulate a microservices architecture that connects to vault to retrieve database credentials. The code and method of connecting to vault can be ignored for the purposes of this test.

## Using an M1 Mac?
If you are using an M1 Mac then you need to install some additional tools:
- [Multipass](https://github.com/canonical/multipass/releases) install the latest release for your operating system
- [Multipass provider for vagrant](https://github.com/Fred78290/vagrant-multipass)
    - [Install the plugin](https://github.com/Fred78290/vagrant-multipass#plugin-installation)
    - [Create the multipass vagrant box](https://github.com/Fred78290/vagrant-multipass#create-multipass-fake-box)

## 👟 Running the sample application
- Make sure you have installed the [vagrant prerequisites](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vagrant/getting-started-index#prerequisites)
- In a terminal execute `vagrant up`
- Once the vagrant image has started you should see a successful terraform apply:
```
default: vault_audit.audit_dev: Creation complete after 0s [id=file]
    default: vault_generic_endpoint.account_production: Creation complete after 0s [id=auth/userpass/users/account-production]
    default: vault_generic_secret.gateway_development: Creation complete after 0s [id=secret/development/gateway]
    default: vault_generic_endpoint.gateway_production: Creation complete after 0s [id=auth/userpass/users/gateway-production]
    default: vault_generic_endpoint.payment_production: Creation complete after 0s [id=auth/userpass/users/payment-production]
    default: vault_generic_endpoint.gateway_development: Creation complete after 0s [id=auth/userpass/users/gateway-development]
    default: vault_generic_endpoint.account_development: Creation complete after 0s [id=auth/userpass/users/account-development]
    default: vault_generic_endpoint.payment_development: Creation complete after 1s [id=auth/userpass/users/payment-development]
    default: 
    default: Apply complete! Resources: 16 added, 6 changed, 0 destroyed.
    default: 
    default: ~
```
*Verify the services are running*

- `vagrant ssh`
- `docker ps` should show all containers running:

```

## ⚙️ Task
Imagine the following scenario, your company is growing quickly 🚀 and increasing the number services being deployed and configured.
It's been noticed that the code in `tf/main.tf` is not very easy to maintain 😢.

The team would like to work on the following problems:

- Improve the Terraform code to make it easier to add/update/remove services
- Add a new environment called `staging` that runs each microservice
- Structure your code in a way that will segregate environments
- Add a README detailing your design decisions, if you are new to Terraform let us know
- Document in your README how your code would fit into a CI/CD pipeline
- Describe anything beyond the scope of this task that you would consider when running this code in a real production environment
- 🚨 The new staging environment should be created when you run `vagrant up` and the apps should print `service started` and the secret data in their logs 🚨
